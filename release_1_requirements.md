# Release requirements
- Full error handling: No rogue unwraps; underlying processes should -always- shut down on crash 
- Core feature refinement: Usage can no longer be exploratory (supported messages, additional states, etc)
	- Must be able to document features completely! 
- Config (ports, etc) as args or home dir config file
