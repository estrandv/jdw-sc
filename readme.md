# JackDAW Supercollider
- SCLang and SCSynth process management
	- OSC library: ROSC has good examples 
	- Async/Thread listener for server callback 
- Structs
	- All incoming messages (or can we do them as maps..?) 
		- Would it be worth it to do some kind of polymorphism? 
		- Like... with common ZMQMessage behaviour like handle and contents? 
	- Outgoing OSC
		- Any wrappers needed, or should we just construct in-function and send?
	- RunningNote impl 
- Templates
	- Could probably outline as structs with to_string() 
	- NRT callback? 
- Cleanup thread
- ZMQ incoming read thread 
- Buffer Data
